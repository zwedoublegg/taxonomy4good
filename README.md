# ðŸª´ Welcome to Good Data Hub

**Join the thousands of data scientists working together to simplify sustainability data**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Why do we care?**

Often, insights derived from unstructured data can complement the information obtained from structured data reports. Since structured corporate and government ESG/sustainability data is reported infrequently, it acts as a lagging indicator. This project aims to address this issue by providing a way to understand sustainability initiatives and actions at a higher cadence\
\
**What is our open source goal?**

Our project is driven by the goal of reducing the barriers associated with accessing and processing sustainability data. We are committed to developing tools that enhance the efficiency and practicality of working with such data\
